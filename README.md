## Description

 - A football analysis and prediction app, created using ReactJS and Flask.
 - This application uses ML and AI to predict predict team and player statistics as well as attributes.

### Server :

 - The server for the app is created using flask.
 - Data scraping is performed on the server, after which we use our own API's to create/fetch JSON data sets.
 - Using these data sets we have created the machine learning models to predict player similarity, market value, expected goals etc using python.
 - We have deployed the developed models on the server. 

### Client :

 - The front-end was created using react. This interactive react app is displayed to the end user.
 - The app includes 5 modules including home, live scores, news, stats and coaches center.
 - Live scores from matches across the world are displayed to user in the live scores modules. These scores can be filtered by leagues.
 - Latest football news is displayed under the news module and various live league and player stats are shown in the stats module.
 - These modules use the data fetched/received from the server through api calls.
 - The coaches center module shows the results from the prediction models developed using machine learning on the server.
